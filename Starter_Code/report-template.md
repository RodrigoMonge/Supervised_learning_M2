## Overview of the Analysis

For this analisis weâ€™ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers by using various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes.

## Results


* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Accuracy: 0.9918489475856377
  * Precision:
      * 0 = 1
      * 1 = 0.85
  * Recall scores:
      * 0 = 0.99
      * 1 = 0.91     

* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Accuracy: 0.9938093272802311
  * Precision
      * 0 = 1
      * 1 = 0.84
  * Recall scores.
      * 0 = 0.99
      * 1 = 0.99
      
## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
Based on the accuracy results and the recall results, we can determine that the imbalanced model is performing better
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )
Due to the nature of the analysis, predicting the `1`'s is more important as it's what our analysis is trying to identify.
